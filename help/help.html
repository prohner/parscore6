<p align="left">          Questionnaire types: PARScore6 offers a total of 42 measures. The questionnaire menu is presented on the initial window when the
  program is launched. Any questionnaire on the menu can be chosen by selecting the
  appropriate button and clicking &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.<br />
  <br />
  Entering data: PARScore6 will present the appropriate datasheet after choosing the
  desired questionnaire type. The database will perform data validity check upon clicking
  the &ldquo;Calculate&rdquo; button. During this check, the database will ensure that all fields are populated with appropriate data values. If any mismatch is detected, it will notify the
  user to correct the data value(s) before moving forward.<br />
  <br />
  Calculating Results: After data entry is complete, clicking the &ldquo;Calculate&rdquo; button
   will show
  the value of all the individual items, the total score of each scale (wherever appropriate),
  and the total test score. PARScore6 will automatically perform any reverse scoring that
  may be necessary.<br />
  <br />
  Saving Results: The &ldquo;Save as&rdquo; option from the file menu allows the user to save the
  results of response to any type of questionnaire. Files saved by PARScore6 will have          &ldquo;.par&rdquo; file extension. <br />
  <br />
  Opening File: Saved files can be opened by choosing &ldquo;Open&rdquo; from the file menu,
  and then browsing to the appropriate location.<br />
  <br />
  Printing Results: Calculated results can be printed by choosing the &ldquo;Print&rdquo;
  option from the file menu. The printed copy will be formatted exactly as it
  appears on the screen.<br />
  <br />
  Switching questionnaire type: Questionnaire type can be changed by
  clicking on &quot;Scoring the Measures&quot; and then choosing from the menu on the page. </p>
<p align="left"> PARScore6 : Working with data files<br />
  <br />
  In PARScore6, data files can be used to compile a large number of responses to any questionnaire within a single file. Data files can then be exported to SPSS in order to
  perform statistical analysis.<br />
  <br />
  Adding data to a new data file: The response to any questionnaire can be added
  to a new data file by choosing &ldquo;Add data to new data file&rdquo; from the data menu. Data files
  created by PARScore6 will have &ldquo;.dat&rdquo; extension.</p>
<p align="left">Adding data to an existing data file: Calculated responses to any questionnaire can be added to an existing data file by choosing &ldquo;Add data to existing data file&rdquo; from the data pull down menu. If the current questionnaire type matches the questionnaire type of
  the data file, then the data will be added. In case of a mismatch, an error message will appear explaining the reason for the failure.<br />
